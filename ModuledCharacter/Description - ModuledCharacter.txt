Modular character system. The goal was to create a character for a unique turn-based dueling combat system with the ability to swap behavior modules. Additionally, the character needed to have its own parameters and the ability to upgrade them. A single character can have an unlimited number of behavior modules of the same type, for example, attacks. Switching between behavior modules of the same type should work based on probability, where each module has a chance to activate.
